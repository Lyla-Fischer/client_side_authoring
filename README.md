# client_side_authoring
An XBlock that provides an authoring interface for the client-side aspects of XBlock, for authors that only want to use the HTML/css/javascript web technologies. 

This is still in active development, and will not have backwards compatibility until it is more officially released. If you are looking at this repository, I hope that you will be interested in the conceptual discussion of what this is trying to do. Feel free to start a conversation with me at lylaedx (at) gmail.com.
